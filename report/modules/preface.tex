\paragraph{Preface}

This report is submitted as part of the course \textit{DAT215-G 25H Multimedieprosjekt} at the University of Agder. It documents the development and completion of our project \textbf{CircuitQuest -- A Logic Gate Educational Tool}, created with the objective of providing an engaging and accessible learning environment for understanding digital logic from fundamentals to advanced topics.

The project was carried out by the following group members: 
Martin Gregor Bruckmeier, Harshal Ghadge, Luis Antonio Gebhardt, 
Luca Alexander Detlef Steinhausen, Lorenz Kruse, and Tækkyon Ari Kesselring.

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our project supervisor, \textbf{Jostein Nordengen}, for his continuous support, valuable guidance, and constructive feedback throughout the entire project process. His insights were instrumental in shaping the final outcome of CircuitQuest.

We also extend our appreciation to the course organiser, \textbf{Morgan Konnestad}, for his organisational efforts. In particular, we thank him for enabling the formation of an unusually large project group, which provided a valuable collaborative learning experience.

The work presented in this report is the result of our collective effort during the semester, and we hope it will serve as a useful contribution within the field of multimedia-based educational tools.
